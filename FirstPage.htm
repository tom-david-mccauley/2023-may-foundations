<h2>Beyond slacktivism: Samaritan and the rise of app-tivism</h2>

<p>“Walk with, not by.” 

<br><br>So goes motto for <a href="https://www.samaritan.city">Samaritan</a>, a mobile app that helps users fight homelessness through direct, case-managed giving.

<br><br>It’s a slogan that rejects slacktivism for what could be called “app-tivism”—the use of consumer apps to generate meaningful social action.

<br><br>More than just sharing news of a cause or signaling one’s ethos with a digital signature—two hallmarks of slacktivism—app-tivism requires tangible action: money raised, lives changed. </p> 

<h3>How Samaritan makes a difference.</h3> 
<p>Samaritan uses a story-driven app that feeds user donations and crowdsourced words of encouragement to people experiencing homelessness. A local social service provider works with the unhoused person to help them reach goals that will eventually get them off the street.

<br><br>It’s powerful, digitally mediated philanthropy. And it’s inspiring a team of young IT entrepreneurs in Omaha to develop their own social media solution, one that calls attention to stories that often go unnoticed, one that allows users to directly help the people featured in those stories <mark>(more on that later)</mark>.
